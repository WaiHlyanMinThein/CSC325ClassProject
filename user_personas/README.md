# User Personas Directory

## Purpose

The purpose of this directory is to house the user personas for the CSC325 class project. User personas are fictional characters created to represent the different user types that might interact with the software. These personas help in understanding the needs, experiences, behaviors, and goals of the users, which is crucial for making user-centered design decisions.

## Contents

This directory includes detailed descriptions of at least three user personas representing key stakeholders for the project. These personas are:

1. **End Users of the Software**: Individuals who will use the software in their daily activities.
2. **Developers of the Software**: Team members responsible for designing, coding, and maintaining the software.
3. **Owner of the Software**: The person or entity that owns the rights to the software and oversees its development and distribution.

Each persona document will contain the following information:
- **Name**: A fictional name for the persona.
- **Role**: The role of the persona in relation to the software.
- **Demographics**: Information such as age, gender, location, etc.
- **Goals and Motivations**: What the persona aims to achieve and what motivates them.
- **Challenges and Pain Points**: The difficulties and issues the persona faces.
- **Narrative or Scenario**: A brief story illustrating how the persona interacts with the software.

## Usage

These personas will be used throughout the project to ensure that the software developed meets the needs and expectations of its intended users. By considering the perspectives of these user personas, students will be able to make more informed decisions about the design, functionality, and user experience of the software.
